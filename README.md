Why do we need to perform memory testing?



  Unreliable RAM, or random-access memory, can cause a number of computer issues, including damaged data, crashes, and unusual, inexplicable behavior. One of the most aggravating   computer problems is having faulty or damaged RAM since the symptoms are sometimes sporadic and difficult to recognize. MemTest86+ is a handy utility for diagnosing defective     RAM that can be downloaded onto a CD/DVD or a USB. System builders, PC repair shops, and PC manufacturers frequently utilize it.
